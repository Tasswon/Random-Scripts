# Random-Scripts
A combination of helpful scripts or small coding projects I've done over the years.

### Calendar
An app script that parses through a set of google sheets and generates a scheduled calendar (actual spreadsheet is private).

## Google
A vb script that can be easily utilized as a console program to generate geocode information from google (coordinates or addresses).

## Sharepoint Create Folders
Builds a sharepoint document library, adds folders, and sets permissions based on an excel spreadsheet.
